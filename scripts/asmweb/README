ASM Web Component
=======================

The ASM web component is a build of ASM that runs as a java applet. The
user hits a webpage with their browser and ASM starts up in the browser
window, pointing to your database. 

DATABASE
=======================

Install MySQL or PostgreSQL

Use the appropriate script in the sql directory to create the database
(mysql.sql or postgresql.sql), followed by an appropriate translation
file for your language (translate_en.sql for English)

WEBSERVER
=======================

Put the asm-applet.jar file and the sample index.html page on
your webserver. Edit index.html and change the jdbcurl property to match 
the location of your mysql or postgresql database server. 

Eg:

jdbc:mysql://192.168.0.1/asm?user=user&password=pass

jdbc:postgresql://192.168.0.1/asm?user=user&password=pass

Alter accordingly for your server's IP address, ASM database name, user
and password.

Note that the database *must* be accessible to the client machines - the
webserver is just a delivery platform for the client program.

CLIENT MACHINES
=========================

The client machines will need the Java plugin installed from http://java.com

MEDIA
=========================

ASM does not include the default media (wordprocessor templates, templates
for the look and feel of reports and internet publishing, etc.) in the database 
structure files, so you will have to import these into the database.

To do this, open ASM in your web browser and go to System->Media Files.

Hit the "import directory from the filesystem here" button and choose
each folder in the media folder supplied here in turn. You should
have "internet", "reports" and "templates" folders.

AUTHENTICATION
=========================

If you don't want ASM to prompt the user to login, you can specify a "user"
parameter to the applet so have ASM automatically login as that user.

Eg:

<param name="user" value="asmuser" />

(where "asmuser" is the name of the user you'd like all users to login as)

If you have a scripting language available, you can use this technique to
use basic authentication or some other webserver authentication to automatically
set the value of the user parameter after a user has logged in by some
other means.

ASM can also authenticate via the operating system user and LDAP. You can set
these in the database by logging in to ASM and going to System->Authentication.

SECURITY
==========================

The jdbcurl parameter in the page is visible to users via the View Page Source
option in their browser. This means that once you have given someone access to
the page, they could make a note of the database login credentials.

You can mitigate this risk by doing the following:

1. Create a different database username and password for each user (so the jdbcurl
is unique to them). Do not give it permission to execute DDL statements (ALTER/DROP). 
When a user leaves your organisation, you can remove their database user.

2. Set up basic authentication on the webserver, protecting the HTML page 
with a different username and password for each user. When a user leaves your
organisation, you can remove their web user.

3. Either use a scripting language to rewrite the webpage to put in the correct
database usernames/password for each user, or use a different HTML page/url for 
each user.

4. You can obfuscate the contents of the jdbcurl parameter by Base64 encoding
it and prefixing the encoded value with "e:". This prevents casual browsing
by users, however anyone who knows what they're doing could decode it.
