ASM Web Component

The ASM web component is a build of ASM that runs as a java applet. The
user hits a webpage with their browser and ASM starts up, pointing
to your database.

To use, put the asm-applet.jar file and the sample index.html page on
your webserver. Edit index.html and change the jdbcurl to match the
location of your mysql or postgresql database. Note that the database
*must* be accessible to the client machines.
