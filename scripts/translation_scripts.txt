Explanation of translation conversions. These are done to convert between sql,
java properties and gettext po files so that translations can be done with
Launchpad Rosetta and converted back again.

java_to_gettext.sh

Reads the java properties files and creates .po files for our supported languages
in src/locale/po
It also creates a .pot file from the en_GB (no property file suffix) files

java_to_pot.sh

Reads the properties files and creates a new .pot file

gettext_to_java.sh

Looks in src/locale/po/ for po files and generates java properties files from them
to match the English template. Note that they should be named with the country
code in there - eg: lt_LT.po

database_to_java.sh

Reads the UTF8 database translation patch files in sql/translate_* and converts them
into Latin1 java properties files in src/locale as database.properties

database_to_java_en.sh

Reads the UTF8 database translation patch files for English only (sql/translate_en.sql) and
recreates the src/locale/database.properties file - the template for the other
languages.

java_to_database.sh

Reads the java database.properties files in src/locale and converts them into
UTF8 translation patch files in sql/
