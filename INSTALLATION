Compiling the application:
===============================

To build the ASM source you will need Apache Ant and GNU Make
(run "make jar")

The ant script's default target builds the program asm.jar and puts it in 
build/

If you already have an installation of ASM, copy this file to your ASM install
directory to test it.

Building the redistributable installers
================================================

There is a GNU Makefile in this directory that will build 
absolutely everything, leaving you with a /build directory of redistributable
installers/packages and the manual. 

Various Makefile targets exist for different platforms (edit the Makefile for
more info) and the Makefile will check that all needed build tools are installed
before starting.

Note that for win32 installer builds, you will need WINE installed, along with
NSIS from http://nsis.sourceforge.net (a recent NSIS installer is supplied in 
install/win32). You will also need the nsisunz.dll
(supplied in install/win32 with the source code) in your Program
Files/NSIS/Plugins directory. The Makefile will automatically copy it for 
you, so all you need to do is "cd install/win32 && wine nsis*setup.exe"
to install NSIS.

Eg:

make win32          [just build the win32 installer]
make macosx linux   [just build the linux/macosx tarballs]
make source deb     [just build a source tarball and a debian package]
make cd             [build everything and an installer CD ISO image]
make [all]          [build everything]

If you are using a Debian-based system (eg: Ubuntu), then the following
will install all the software you need for a complete build:

apt-get install ant sun-java6-jdk lyx latex2html dpkg alien inkscape tar zip unzip wine doxygen mkisofs recode translate-toolkit
