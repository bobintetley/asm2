2.3.0 (Pulled while HSQLDB migration sorted)
============================================

*. Preferences interface for HeartbeatInterval
*. Animal search results print showed animal names out of sequence 
-  if it was sorted before printing
*. Configurable database heartbeat interval with the
-  HeartbeatInterval=ms value in asm.properties
*. MacOSX/generic Unix scripts use Swing renderer, which requires
-  more RAM available in the heap.
*. Button on animal comments to copy to web media for the animal
*. SelectableTable implementation for MacOS instead of SelectablePane
-  (this doesn't use scroll/direct renderering, but is not as good)
*. getConnection tests whether connection is open before proceeding
-  (helps with remote databases with very low timeouts)
*. Prefill media notes wasn't working (should default animal comments
-  when you create a new media record).
*. Fixed MacOSX SwingWT bug that meant scrollbars could disappear
-  from the options and user permissions pages
*. HasActiveReserve flag was being set to the opposite of its meaning
-  (this affected animal searching). Need to re archive animal records
-  (or shut ASM down once) for it to take effect.
*. When calculating highest ever code, looks at records created in
-  the last 12 months, since they should (by definition) be higher
-  than anything else and it's a smaller set to search.
*. Removed noisy logging when parsing bad codes (unless debug enabled)
*. Added Swing package for MacOSX as Carbon seems unstable on some
-  Mac systems
*. Highest year/ever values are not calculated if the format code
-  does not use it (saves unnecessary database calls)
*. Rewrote getIDFromCombo/setComboFromID to use lookup caches instead
-  of making database calls
*. Added HasSpecialNeeds wordkey
*. 1800saveapet, pets911, petfinder publishers use media notes
-  for animal description (as they should have in the first place).
*. Fix for upper case image files in media
*. Added WebMediaNew and WebMediaUpdated animal wordkeys (they
-  update automatically as animals are published to the web and
-  allow the site generator to flag new/changed animals)
*. Medical diary should only include on-shelter animals
*. Animal Clone now includes everything but media
*. Animal Delete removes all satellite data
*. Added facility for custom coding formats
*. Hooks for forthcoming French translation
*. Wrong key used for Add Animal in menu

*. Added Special Needs checkbox to vets tab (used by PetFinder and
-  SaveAPet publisher)
*. Animal buttons not enabling after save
*. Short shelter codes aren't valid for non-XYYYYNNN coding systems
*. System options didn't allow changing of short code flag

2.2.2
================

*. Brought manual upto date.
*. Fixed various areas where security was missing and closed the
-  double click selector bug (which allowed users to open screens
-  they didn't have permissions to).
*. Hitting ok on the authentication screen wasn't closing the screen.
*. Change permissions weren't preventing users changing animal, owner, 
-  lost/found, diary note, owner donations and waiting list records 
-  due to new UI scheme.

2.2.1
================

*. Fixed URLLabel bug (URLs look like URLs again and have correct
-  cursor)
*. Internet publisher uploads all images as -1.jpg, -2.jpg, starting
-  at -1 now. It will also not upload the MEDIAID.jpg file if upload
-  all is set, assuming you can handle CODE-X.jpg in your templates
-  yourself.
*. PetFinder publisher uploads all images as -1.jpg, -2.jpg, etc,
-  starting at -1 now.
*. HSQLDB checkpoint interval is now every 30 seconds.
*. HSQLDB uses CSV storage for all tables but DBFS, so in the event
-  of any kind of corruption problem with the cached data, 99% of the
-  data is retrievable. The cost is performance (this only affects
-  new installs).
*. Use localdb.script to test for existence of local database.
*. Tidying of publishing templates to make them XHTML compliant and
-  operate better with the patasunidas.com and sheltermanager.com
-  search engines.
*. Organisation address and telephone number boxes on system options.
-  They can be accessed in the WWW publisher with the $$ORGNAME$$, 
-  $$ORGADDRESS$$ and $$ORGTEL$$ keys for the header/footer. They
-  are included in the default media templates. $$ORGEMAIL$$ can also
-  be used and is supplied by the ASM FROM email account.
*. Date boxes will no longer let you use dates more than 10 years in
-  the future, or 100 years in the past (based on today's date). This
-  solves the date range bug in HSQL and stops people putting in ridiculous
-  dates when making typos (one shelter had a bunch of vaccinations to
-  be performed in 20089).
*. The HTML and PetFinder publishers have a new "uploadall" option, which 
-  will include all of the animal's images. The preferred will be called
-  sheltercode.jpg, with the remainder sheltercode-1.jpg, sheltercode-2.jpg,
-  etc. Note that the HTML templates can't use these extra images 
-  (unless you know how many there will be and put $$SHELTERCODE$$-1.jpg
-  in pib.dat), it's for shelters that do other processing on the output.
*. Added new "dbfsupload", "dbfsdownload" and "dbfsdelete" command line
-  options for manipulating the DBFS. Both can handle directories and
-  are documented in the manual.
*. Added system options interface to AllowDBAutoUpdates
*. Added AllowDBAutoUpdates flag (set to No in configuration to disable
-  ASM's auto database update feature).
*. Changing owner surname/address enables save button again
*. Fixed tooltips on preferences screen dropdowns for tabs/labels

-  to use new UI abstraction (final tidying up).
*. Hotkeys are used if a button has text, so the toggle only applies to
-  icon buttons.
*. Removed hotkey assignment for combo search

*. Combo boxes have a search button that appears once they have more than
-  20 items in them. It uses the new InputListDialog functionality to
-  do the search.
*. FlexibleFocusManager recognises our composites to save mucking around
-  with getTabOrder
*. Animal.getMostRecentEntry takes account of FosterOnShelter flag

-  saving to database) and edit voucher converted to new scheme
*. Date of birth tooltip shows animal's age
*. Fix for local cache concurrent modification in delete.
*. Cache viewer, profiles viewer, litter viewer, file types handler 
-  and diary tasks use new UI scheme. This is the last of the viewer
-  screens done.

*. Fix for save a pet publisher to stop it getting into an endless loop
-  when faced with an animal that isn't a dog or cat.

*. Keystrokes in ASMView/Selector now trigger updating tool buttons
*. New databases default max media file size of 1MB
*. Date picker button for date fields
*. Fixed find animal tab ordering
*. Checkpointing is either done on a 5 minute timer (single threaded 
-  access mode added to DB calls) or on shutdown rather than with
-  every save to prevent slowdown on larger databases.
*. Fixed heartbeat to no longer shunt onto dispatch thread (and
-  block UI) as new single threaded DB code will prevent this and
-  allow it to work in the background.
*. Add media auto scales images according to configuration table
-  (has no UI component on purpose, but can be hand edited in the
-  database). Add screen converted to new UI scheme and outputs 
-  default scaling on screen.
*. Speeded up empty DBFS check.

-  now done).
*. Selecting a template uses alphanumeric ordering for the list
*. Disabled media files import from fs option (it's dangerous and
-  not needed now).
*. Owner link button on the animal disables if the animal has no active
-  movement.
*. Today's date is now defaulted for new movements that have a type,
-  but no date given.
*. Refactored UI class names to obey sensible scheme - embedded panels
-  that manage data have a Selector suffix, forms that do the same
-  job are suffixed with View, Edit and Find forms are suffixed now.
*. All owner selectors refactored.
*. Search forms default the search button for enter now and switch to
-  open/select when a search is performed.
*. Find animal converted to new scheme.
*. Progress meter is stepped for searches to save blocking thread
-  switches during table population (improves performance by a lot
-  when filling table for find animal/owner)
*. Added ASMSearchForm base class and converted Find Lost Animal to work
-  with it. Makes the code much cleaner and handles button disabling.
*. Fixed SwingWT to allow override of tool buttons in favour of push
-  buttons.
*. Altered new panel class to set insets correctly for nicer layout.
*. Added -Dasm.ram=RAM switch for WindowsBoot class. This means you can
-  edit the windows shortcut and put (for example) -Dasm.ram=128 to
-  have ASM use 128MB of RAM. The new default is 96MB since a lot of
-  Windows users use the local database (which requires a cache).
*. Altered PetFinder publisher to use separate option fields (PF have
-  remove single options field).
*. Rewrote medical selector into separate components with umbrella
-  component (easier to maintain and understand). Treatment editing
-  done.
*. Converted JDBC dialog to new scheme and added database field
-  so it can be specified (it defaults to "asm" just in case).
*. Converted movement selection screen
*. Converted log types
*. Extracted vaccinations into separate tableview screen
*. Removed -Xms/Xmx/Xss settings from Linux/Unix scripts - it's better
-  to let the VM implementations decide (for some reason ASM takes twice
-  as much memory if you specify -Xmx128m on Java 6)
*. Removed pointless pack() command from Main.addChild() and severely
-  speeded up the UI.
*. Moved criteria package into the UI
*. Rewrote ASM Main form with new UI scheme. Split component
-  creation for ease of reading/maintainability.

*. Start of new UI library to simplify form programming for ASM
-  (still experimental, first screen done - Edit Diary).
*. Edit owner uses lookup cache
*. Fixed owner thumbnails for png images
*. Town/City and County/State fields are dropdowns, populated from 
-  previous data. They are also linked, so changing a town will
-  update the list of counties.
*. Updated manual images
*. Fixed hideous About screen
*. Default Ok button on database selector so you can hit enter
*. Removed pngs from doc/help/Makefile clean target
*. Cleaned up status panel on main screen to have icons for current

*. Fixed owner name searching to handle apostrophes
*. Added xulrunner dependency for deb and fix to set MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME
-  correctly.

2.1.1
================

*. Added folder import/export to media screen and added hotkeys and
-  intelligent button enabling.
*. Disabled database copying - the import option works much better and
-  is less confusing (pull data from *this* other database into my
-  current one).
*. Database selector not only checks the connection, but verifies there's
-  an ASM database there now. 
*. Acceptance should read Litter ID on View Litters screen
*. Added additional credits and updated AUTHORS
*. Media files display alphabetically now
*. If you don't have defaulting of codes turned on and you tab through the
-  type box, it will now generate an animal code if the animal doesn't have
-  one.
*. Downloading a media file defaults the media's filename.
*. Added asm.log.debug system property to turn off debugging messages

-  to the default path for the platform.
*. Fixed tabbing in date from/to selection screen
*. Manually set widths for animal fields for Vista.

*. Better grid spacing throughout to not let components sit right next
-  to each other.
*. Added title labels to embedded owner control and fixed auto sizing.

*. New switch database dialog offers a much friendlier way of dealing with
-  databases (no need for JDBC URLs). ASM will also always fall back to
-  a local database and make sure one is present so that it can always
-  be started up. The dialog also checks all connections before allowing
-  the user to proceed, so they can't break their ASM. This dialog is
-  now used on startup and during copy/import operations.
*. Fixed date format to use ISO for PostgreSQL (workaround for older
-  PostgreSQL date format problem). This solves the problem of foreign
-  locales getting SQL representations of date fields.
*. Added translation test shortcut for Windows (appears in install directory).
-  This allows people doing translations to test ASM with their new
-  values (after unpacking asm.jar) without having to edit anything.
*. Fixed bad layout of animal name editing screen.
*. Refactoring of startup code to fix MacOSX native renderer.
*. Reinstated MacOSX native renderer, ready for testing.

-  directory for 98/ME users.
*. Added more splash screens - all my beasts are on!
*. Reinstated start maximised option and made default screen size larger
-  to cope with larger monitor resolutions (and to ensure animal screen
-  has all fields available).
*. Cleaned up build file and some tweaks for SwingWTUtils, so it can be
-  removed by preprocessing the code.
*. Builds are version/timestamped automatically by "make jar" now.

2.1.0-1
================

*. Added UTF-8 fix for SQL files (causes problems for UTF chars on Windows

-  are unaffected)

2.1.0
================

*. Added Spanish translation and database patch (many thanks to
-  Andrés Palomare and Vasco Marques)
*. Updated splash/artwork to match CD
*. Random splash screens for a bit of variety (using photos of my animals

-  for the country is not the US
*. Added code formatter and script that removes all old netbeans plugin comments
-  from the code

*. Intelligent adoption donations - ASM learns what the normal donation
-  amount is for an adoption of each species of animal and defaults it
-  automatically.
*. Intelligent breed selection - ASM learns what breeds go with which
-  species and presents them based on how common each breed is to your
-  shelter.
*. Massively improved lookup data caching strategy to make edit/search
-  animal pages load faster.
*. Removed jikes build dependency - javac isn't that much slower these
-  days.
*. Created linked owner record for animal's vet instead of free form
-  box. Existing free form box is transferred to health problems
-  field.
*. Moved wordkeys into an appendix of the manual and added better explanations
-  for the keys.
*. Doxygen system documentation
*. Removed unused utility classes
*. Better integrated Win32 installer (no more DOS box popping up for
-  extraction of zip files).
*. Locale selector on startup so the rest of the system is guaranteed to
-  know the locale immediately (for future use in multilingual 
-  databases/manuals). Cleaned up locale handling.
*. Switch to GNU Make build system and cleaned up all areas of the build
*. Language specific manual support
*. Restructured packages to use net.sourceforge.sheltermanager - it's only
-  lived there for 6 years or so!
*. Removed MySQL info from Mac installer (to match others) - MySQL should
-  be handled separately.
*. Streamlined language files and removed all unnecessary en_US entries
*. Fixed missing comments on donations tab

-  for maintenance, etc.
*. Consolidated all use of Runtime.exec() with more robust version to fix 
-  the problem of Windows Process.waitFor() never completing.
*. The "noKids" PetFinder flag has never worked (there was no code to
-  set it - only for dogs/cats).
*. New {IMAGE.animalid} tag for custom reports - will embed an image in
-  a custom report.
*. Fix for sequencing in animal aggregate data updating for the db
-  returning records out of order
*. Reinstated old replace code as regex breaks with most publishing
-  tokens. PetFinder publishing (reason for change) uses direct regex
-  anyway.
*. Patch from Chris Thomas to make ASM integrate correctly with the Mac
-  OSX menu bar and display icons correctly.
*. Removed old (and unused) activation nonsense

-  movement types in the database see their new names).
*. Removed common fields from global resource fields so I only have to
-  change one version number.
*. Added en_IN locale with Rs. currency symbol.

2.0.21
================

-  (win32/swt can look quite awful on Windows Server 2003 and over RDP
-   with broken PNG alpha and things, so you at least have a choice).
*. Fixed broken icon link on Export Custom Report as CSV
*. Obfuscation of LDAP bind password in database.
*. New Not For Adoption book to quickly show all animals on the shelter
-  not available for adoption.
*. Database importer no longer imports configuration table (not necessary

-  from old databases now.
*. Added single instance lock file, can be toggled under Preferences
-  settings to only allow one instance of ASM open at a time.
*. Improved debugging for LDAP authentication.
*. Tidied up debug logging and dialog wait time code.

*. View users displays real name as well as username.
*. MD5 integration for all database user functions.
*. New Authentication page on system menu to choose how ASM will authenticate

*. OS authentication is now stricter - if it's set and you don't have a
-  matching ASM user, ASM will refuse to let you in. This is equivalent
-  to ident security on some Unix applications.
*. Lock user menu item now authenticates with LDAP.
*. Lock user and Login Again now disabled for OS authentication (since they
-  aren't valid).
*. MD5 hashing code.
*. Removed FindMeAPet menu.

-  from any V3 compliant LDAP server, as long as the user exists in
-  ASM's own database as well.
*. Expiring members mail merge.
*. Instalment donations now available from movement records.
*. Database importer doesn't override JDBC URL anymore and defaults
