This directory contains scripts for building a Debian installation
package for Animal Shelter Manager.

Run the "makedeb.sh" shell script in this directory to build the
deb file.

An additional script, "makerpm.sh" will generate an RPM that should
work on any RPM distro (Suse, Mandrake, Fedora, etc.)
