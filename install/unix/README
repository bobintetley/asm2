Animal Shelter Manager (BSD/HP-UX/AIX/Solaris)
===========================================================

You need to install a Sun JRE (and PostgreSQL/MySQL optionally)
from your distribution prior to running anything in this package.

You will also need the zip/unzip command line utilities (used by the 
template engine for handling OpenOffice documents) installed or
symlinked to /usr/bin/zip and /usr/bin/unzip

If you want to use MySQL/PostgreSQL, scripts can be found in
data/sql to set up the database. Otherwise, ASM will auto-create
an HSQLDB for you in ~/.asm/localdb.*

You can then use the run.sh script to start ASM. Symlink this script
to /usr/bin/asm ( ln -s run.sh /usr/bin/asm ) so you can just use
"asm" to start ASM from a terminal. You could also make GNOME/CDE/etc.
shortcuts to the run script (an XPM icon is provided).
