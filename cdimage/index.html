<h1>Animal Shelter Manager Installation CD</h1>

<h2>Microsoft Windows:</h2>

<p>Run the setup.exe file from the CD. The CD has an autorun file for
Windows so setup should start immediately after inserting the CD for
normal Windows PCs.</p>

<h2>Apple Macintosh OSX:</h2>

<p>Copy the sheltermanager_x86ppc_macosx.tar.gz file from the
CD to your Applications folder. Double click it to unpack.
Double click the ASM application to start.</p>

<h2>Linux:</h2>

<p>DEB and RPM packages are supplied on the CD. If you don't
have an RPM/DEB distribution, copy the sheltermanager_linux.tar.gz
file to /usr/local or your home directory and unpack it with
tar -zxvf sheltermanager_linux.tar.gz. Use the run.sh script in the
asm folder to start ASM.</p>

<h2>Other Unix:</h2>

<p>A binary tarball is supplied that should run on most Unices (tested
with NetBSD and HP-UX, but should work with Solaris, AIX and other BSDs).
Unpack the tarball and use the run.sh script to fire it up. Java/Swing
support is required along with X11.</p>

<h2>Development Snapshot:</h2>

<p>A snapshot of the development environment is also included in 
sheltermanager_devenvironment.tar - this is a complete image of the ASM
development environment with full sources, build scripts, libraries, etc.
as at that release (the full contents of 
the subversion repository). Use this if you intend to do some development
on ASM.
</p>

<p>A smaller sheltermanager_src.tar.bz2 file is also included, which contains
just the sources without all the associated libraries. Use this if you just
want to browse the sources without wanting to do any development or building
of ASM.
