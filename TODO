*. Use batching for the updateAllAnimalStatuses and updateOnShelterAnimalStatus
   functions. 
   1. Batch read the whole set of animals to be checked
   2. Batch read adoptions for all of those animals.
   3. Pass those sets to the updateAnimalStatus function
   4. It will slice the adoptions on the client side instead
   5. All changes to be made are added to a query batch, which is
      sent in one go - in particular, the updateVariableData call
      which makes an UPDATE query for each call (but is quite efficient
      apart from that, those updates could be a batch tracked by
      updateOnShelterAnimalVariableData)
