*. Have a version of executeAction that can send a batch of action queries
   (accepts an array of strings). For normal databases it will just push
   them down the connection. For our HTTP type, it can send the batch in
   one go, separated by a special marker so the HTTP driver can run them all
   at once on the server to save overhead.
*. This should hopefully be used to save time with auto archive routines
