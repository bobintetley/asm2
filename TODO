*. Make account description a dropdown and cache list of transactions->accounts
*. Use two nested borderlayouts, both with NORTH so that buttons appear below
   fields correctly when showing transaction screen
*. Maybe make account code more prominent when viewing transactions?
*. Show source account and transaction screen (with from and to labels)
*. Make reconciled transactions appear in blue text instead of black (numbers are still black/red)
