The first time you start ASM, it will prompt you for your locale (a combination
 of the language you speak and the country you live in).
 Click on the locale box to have ASM display a list of every single language/reg
ion it knows how to handle.
 If yours isn't supported, pick the one closest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ASM will then create a new database to hold your information, stored in
 the .asm directory under your home directory.

\begin_layout Standard
Once logged in, ASM's main screen will appear.
 Across the top, a menu bar is used to navigate the system.
 Below the menu, a toolbar is available for fast access to commonly used
 options.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By default, a startup page will show in the main pane, showing current diary
 tasks to be performed today, and any news from the ASM website.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the bottom of the screen, a status bar shows details of currently running
 tasks in the lower left corner, and to the right of it, a progress meter
 shows how far the current task is from completion.
 A number of status icons appear to the right of the progress meter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The remainder of the screen space is given over to the desktop window.
 Animal shelter manager screens appear in tabs inside this window.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You open screens in ASM by navigating and clicking on menu items.
 There are three types of menu in the bar.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Top-Level menus
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\series bold
Top-Level menus
\end_layout

\end_inset

:
\series default
 These are the words you see across the very top of the menu, such as 
\series bold

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

File
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\series default
 and 
\series bold

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Diary
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\series default
.
 These menus drop down to reveal other options.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Sub-Menus
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\series bold
Sub-Menus
\end_layout

\end_inset

:
\series default
 These are menus within the top-level menus and contain logical groupings
 of commands (eg: 
\series bold
File->Animal
\series default
 is a submenu, containing options relating to animal records).
 You can identify submenus as they have small arrows to the right of them,
 indicating that they open a further menu.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Menu Commands
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\series bold
Menu Commands
\end_layout

\end_inset

:
\series default
 These are the menu commands that actually do something.
 Eg: Add Animal is a menu command - it calls up the Animal screen with a
 new record, ready for entry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Shortcut Keys
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Shortcut Keys
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of the menu commands can be actioned by pressing combinations of certain
 keys.
 These keys are known as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

shortcut keys
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

accelerators
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Pressing these keys is the same as navigating the menu and clicking on
 them with the mouse.
 If a menu command has a shortcut key, it will be displayed at the side
 of it in the menu.
 For example, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Add Animal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 option on the menu can be accessed by pressing 
\series bold
CTRL+N
\series default
 - this means you hold down the ConTRoL key and tap 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

N
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It is worth learning these as you will find them much quicker to use when
 you are proficient with the system.
 Note, when running on MacOSX, ASM uses CMD instead of CTRL for shortcut
 keys (the apple key).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a set of extra shortcut keys that apply to all screens when that
 application is running (all of which have entries on the 
\series bold
File
\series default
 menu):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
CTRL+R
\series default
 - will reload the data in a tab.
 For find tabs it will rerun the search, for tabs with tables it will reload
 the data in the tables, for the animal and owner tabs, it will reload the
 data from the database, reverting any changes you have made.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
CTRL+S
\series default
 - will save the contents of the current tab to the database.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
CTRL+W
\series default
 - will close the current tab.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to the menus, Animal Shelter Manager offers a toolbar for certain
 commonly used menu options.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you hover the mouse over a toolbar button, it will tell you what it is
 for.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the bottom part of the screen is the ASM status bar.
 The majority of it is given over to information messages while tasks are
 progressing.
 The right hand side contains a progress meter and upto four icons.
 Hovering over the icons with the mouse gives additional information.
 From left to right, these icons are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Audit information (small document icon).
 This displays who created and last changed the current record on the screen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Database information (small database icon).
 This displays information on the database you are currently connected to,
 giving the database type and the host machine where it is running.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
User information (small user icon).
 This displays the name of the user you are currently logged in as.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Locale information (the ISO two letter language code and country flag).
 This displays the the country/language ASM is set to use.
 You may right click on the icon and choose a different country/language
 to switch locales.
 Note that while the menu and toolbar will change, any screens you currently
 have open will not change languages until you close and reopen them.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth mentioning early on that Animal Shelter Manager has a keyboard
 user interface for dealing with dates (as well as the more usual calendar
 button).
 Every field within the system where a date is expected, the following keyboard
 shortcuts can be used:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
T - Inserts today's date (erasing any current date)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Y - Adds one year to the current date
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
M - Adds one month to the current date
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
W - Adds one week to the current date
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
D - Adds one day to the current date
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
SHIFT + (YMWD) - Subtracts a year/month/week/day from the current date
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
B - Move to the beginning of the current month
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
E - Move to the end of the current month
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ASM uses tables to display data throughout the application.
 You can sort any table in ascending order by clicking on the column heading
 you wish to sort on.
 If you hold down SHIFT while you click the column heading, it will be sorted
 in descending order instead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Initial Setup
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before doing anything else with your new ASM installation, you should now
 perform the initial configuration of ASM for your shelter.
 The steps are as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If you want to use your own animal classifications, you can use the 
\series bold
System->Lookups->Animal Types
\series default
 to alter the standard ASM ones - ASM assumes your shelter deals with dogs
 and cats and wants to differentiate between stray and abandoned animals.
 After doing that, select your new defaults in the correct place on the
 defaults tab of the 
\series bold
System->Options
\series default
 screen (See 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Configure-Reporting-and-Defaults"

\end_inset

)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Go to the 
\series bold
System->Options
\series default
 screen and enter your shelter's details.
 You can set all of the systemwide behaviours for ASM and control the format
 of generated animal codes here.
 See 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:System-Options"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Go to 
\series bold
System->Lookups->Remove unwanted breeds and species
\series default
 - Remove any unwanted breeds and species from the database that your shelter
 does not deal with.
 See 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Unwanted-Breeds-and-Species"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Make sure you have a word processor installed on your computer if you want
 to use ASM to generate adoption paperwork, kennel cards, etc.
 You can tell ASM which word processor you are using on the 
\series bold
System->Options
\series default
 screen (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:System-Options"

\end_inset

).
 ASM supports all versions of Open Office, Microsoft Word 2007, Abiword
 and versions of Microsoft Word older than 2007 through the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Rich Text Format Compatible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 word processor option.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Create usernames and passwords for your shelter staff in the 
\series bold
System->Edit System Users
\series default
 screen.
 Once you have your own username and password, delete the default 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Find Animal Screen
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ASM has two methods of finding animals.
 The default is the simple screen:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace 0.3cm
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename asm_findanimalsimple.png
	width 4in

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace 0.3cm
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simple search screen accepts a single search term.
 The toolbar at the top allows you to submit and execute your search, open
 any selected animal for viewing/editing, clear the criteria field and print
 the search results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the single search term, this screen searches all aspects of the animal,
 including codes, names, breeds, microchip numbers, original owner details,
 media and movements.
 Animals are shown irrespective of where they are (the location field displays
 where the animal is) or whether or not they are dead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, searching for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

black
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 would return animals with black in the name, animals that are black in
 colour, animals adopted to an owner with the surname black, etc.
 Results are sorted by relevance, so if the term appears in an animal's
 name or code, it will be at the top of the list.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By clicking the Advanced button, you can go to a more sophisticated search
 screen that allows you to search by animal location and state, age, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can change which find animal screen is shown by default under the 
\series bold
System->Options
\series default
 menu (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:System-Options"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace 0.3cm
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename asm_findanimal.png
	width 4in

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace 0.3cm
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Advanced screen allows you to enter detailed searches for groups of
 animals within your database.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you press the search button without entering any criteria, you will get
 a list of all animals on the shelter who are still alive.
 This is because the location box defaults to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Only Animals On Shelter
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 - if you change this to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

(all)
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 you will get all animals who are still alive, wherever they are.
 This is because the search automatically excludes dead animals.
 If you wish to include dead animals, tick the box labeled 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Include deceased
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you press the search button, ASM will search through your database
 and check each record against any criteria you have chosen, and return
 to you a list of all those that matched.
 For example, you could quite easily search for all animals of species 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Dog
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 who are still on the shelter, located in a particular location and under
 6 months old.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The criteria fields follow one of three types:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Drop Down Boxes:
\series default
 You should select something from the list or the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

(all)
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 entry to specify that you do not want to filter by this criteria.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Text Boxes:
\series default
 The system expects you to type part of a word, name or code etc.
 For example, typing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ben
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Name
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 box on the find animal screen will return all animals who have 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ben
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 somewhere in their name - eg: Ben, Benji, Benson etc.
 Some boxes require numbers - the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

aged between
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 boxes require an animal age expressed as a year, or fraction of a year.
 Entering 0 in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

From Age
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 box and 0.5 in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

To Age
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 box will return animals who are six months old and younger.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Check Boxes:
\series default
 Here, you are expected to tick the box to indicate a yes or no value -
 eg: Ticking the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Include Deceased
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 box includes dead animals in your search results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For more information about what the criteria boxes expect, hover your mouse
 over them.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Printing Search Results
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Print button on the Find Animal screen allows you to output the results
 of your last search.
 In fact, Animal Shelter Manager generates an HTML report from your search
 results and displays it to you.
 Because all reports are formatted as HTML, you can choose how they look
 (discussed later), email them, edit them, mail them to people or even upload
 them straight to the internet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to sort by the various columns by clicking on their names
 (this applies to all table views within Animal Shelter Manager).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Animal Screen
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The animal screen is the one you will certainly use the most often within
 the system.
 Across the top, the animal screen has a toolbar that relates to actions
 that take place at the animal level.
 From this toolbar, you can clone the animal to create a new one, delete
 the animal, generate a document and execute a diary task.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most importantly, you can save the current record.
 In a manner similar to a document, when you open any file within Animal
 Shelter Manager, what you get is a personal copy of it on the screen -
 it is not submitted to the database for other people to view until you
 explicitly save your changes, and when you do, everything is sent.
 If you make changes to an animal record and forget to save it, the system
 will pick up on this and ask you if you want to save, to make sure you
 do not lose your changes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Below the toolbar, the animal screen is split into a number of different
 tabbed sections.
 Clicking these tabs makes that area of the animal active.
 Because not all of the information is mandatory or applicable to every
 animal, some of the tabs will show a graphic to highlight that they have
 information (the graphic varies according to what type of data is available
 on that particular tab).

The animal details tab contains all the basic information about the animal,
 including it's breed, species, name, age, location within the shelter,
 identifying code etc.

\end_layout

\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (as shown in the screenshot).
 Tick this box if the animal is nothing to do with your shelter, but you
 want to utilise ASM's facilities in managing vaccinations, etc.
 This is very useful for shelters that run their own clinics which are open
 to members of the public (and of course it allows clinics and vets to run
 their operations with ASM too if they don't handle adoptions, etc).
 ASM will force non-shelter animals to have the non-shelter type so that
 you can see from the code that the animal does not belong to the shelter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Below the animal's name, you can also tick a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

not for adoption
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 flag, which enables you to hide this animal from the internet publishers.

 cost.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, you can add cost types through the

 Again, as it deals with a potentially unlimited amount of information,
 the media tab has its own toolbar.
 Click the new button to attach a new piece of media to the animal.
 When you attach media, it is stored with the animal and you no longer need
 the original file - it is quite safe to delete it.
 Since images are the most common use, the file browser will display previews
 of images, and if you highlight an image in the media list, a preview window
 will open to the right (as shown in the screenshot) and show you the image.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the content is not an image, you can click the view button on the toolbar
 to open it with its associated application.
 You may also attach notes of an unlimited size to each piece of media.
 The web publisher can use these notes when building a site, so you could
 use the notes with the image to be used for the web to store the paragraph(s)
 of information about the animal.
\end_layout

 of animals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To start with, it is best to explain how the movement system works; each
 movement record represents a leaving and returning transaction.
 You can therefore only have one (or no) active movement record at a time.
 ie.
 No more than one unreturned movement.
 This is because the animal cannot leave the shelter in two different ways
 without being returned first.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A special exception to this is reservations - since they are not actually
 a movement (the animal hasn't gone anywhere), you can have one or more
 reservations as well as an open movement.
 You should turn the reservation into an adoption movement when the animal
 is adopted and cancel any other outstanding reservations (if it detects
 multiple reservations, ASM will prompt and cancel other reservations for
 you when you turn one into an adoption).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any method by which an animal leaves your shelter requires a movement record

ASM has a special kind of movement called a

 movement.
 This movement should be used if your shelter sells animals through retailers
 (pet shops, etc.).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To use this, you need to create at least one owner on the system with the
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Retailer
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 flag set.
 When an animal goes to a retailer, you create a retailer movement, moving
 the animal to the retailer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Animals at retailers are still classed as on the shelter for reporting purposes,
 however you may then use the additional retailer reports to generate informatio
n about retailers (inventories, volumes moved, average time, etc)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When an owner adopts the animal and the paperwork is received by the shelter,
 you should return the animal from the retailer movement, create the real
 owner record and adopt the animal to it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Movement records also hold a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

from retailer
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 field, which allows you to identify a successful adoption to an owner through
 a particular retailer.
 If an animal's previous moment is a return from a retailer, ASM will ask
 if this adoption has been done through the retailer on the previous movement.
 If you answer yes, ASM will automatically set the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_layout Standard
ASM uses a match point algorithm to determine how close the match is between
 the lost and found animal (or similar shelter animal, which it will also
 check for).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where the system compares two user defined pieces of text (eg.
 Distinguishing features), the system will represent the final score as
 the number of words from the lost animal field that appeared in the found
 animal field, expressed as a fraction of the total points available for
 that field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, suppose I had a lost animal with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

white paws, bell
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for the distinguishing features.
 If there was a found animal with features 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

white paws, torn ear and a bell
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, that would constitute a 100% match on that particular field because every
 single word from the lost animal field appeared in the found animal field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If I had a found animal with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

white paws, no collar
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for the distinguishing features, that would constitute a 66% match, because
 the match was 2/3 words.

The Vets diary is a cross between the General Diary and the Vaccination
 Diary.
 It is highly useful for shelters that have their own clinic or vets.
 The vets diary will show you a list of all general diary notes on the system,
 due today (or before) that are tied to a specific animal and marked for
 the attention of a person named 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Vets
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 (Note: It only has to be assigned to the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Vets

 - it is not necessary to create a system user with that name).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It will then mix appropriately the vaccinations from the vaccination diary
 (ie.
 Vaccinations required today or before for animals on the shelter) and break
 them down by internal location (so a list of what requires doing to each
 animal within each area of the shelter is produced).

NOTE:

 This report

 Just because the animal has left does not mean the task doesn't need doing).
 If an animal is not on the shelter for any reason but still has an active
 diary note, it will be listed under 
\emph on
the last internal location the system saw that animal in
\emph default

 The animal's logical current location will be shown beside it to inform
 you that the animal is no longer on the shelter and for what reason.
 The vaccinations however

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to the normal facilities offered by the general diary, Animal
 Shelter Manager allows you a special type of diary note, called a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Diary Task
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 A diary task is a group of diary notes that can be added to the system
 at relative dates with variable information applicable to animals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This sounds far more complicated than it is, so let us use an example: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose your shelter runs its own clinic and they need to know when young
 animals need to be neutered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem with a regular diary note in this scenario is that there are
 two reminders that need to go together - the first is that the animal must
 be starved before the operation, as well as a reminder for the operation
 itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The solution is to create a diary task with two task items - one for the
 starving and one for the neutering the following day.
 Diary task items do not have a concept of a date - they are expressed as
 a day value relative to today, called a 
\emph on
day pivot
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\emph on
day pivot
\end_layout

\end_inset


\emph default
.
 This is because diary tasks are templates for creating diary notes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the example above, we would create a new diary task called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Starve and Neuter
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The task would have two items on its list (diary tasks can have an unlimited
 number of items); one for the starving and one for the neutering.
 The day pivot on the starving will be a 0 - zero means that the system
 should ask the user for the actual date to go on that task when they apply
 it to the animal (after all, you can book a neuter operation for any time).
 The day pivot on the operation will be a 1 - because it occurs one day
 after the starving.
 This is because diary tasks are cumulative - each one is performed in order
 and the day pivot is taken relative to the date on the task that ran before
 it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we created another task for after the operation, say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Check on the animal in a week
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, then we would set the day pivot to 7, because the task comes after the
 operation and it should generate a reminder 7 days from the operation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next thing to look at is the content of the data itself - it's alright
 having a task that says 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Starve Animal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Neuter Animal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but how do you know which animal? Simple, the wordkeys mentioned in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Documents"

\end_inset

 can also be embedded in the subject and note text of a diary task, to be
 replaced by the real thing when the task is executed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This means that the subject of the starve task could be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Starve <<ShelterCode>> <<AnimalName>>
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for example, which would give the note the animal's shelter code and name
 in the subject line, so you knew which animal the diary note referred to.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even if your task has only one item, diary tasks are still handy to use
 because they can be called up and attached to animals very quickly without
 the need for the user to type a whole new note.
\end_layout

ASM will show you a list of all accounts on the system, with current balances.
 ASM comes preloaded with a basic set of accounts you can use to get started.
 The use of Type::Name when creating codes for accounts is just a convention,
 and you are free to use anything you like.
 It is quite a useful convention though, as it enables you to see at a glance
 the account type and ASM will group accounts of the same type together
 when showing you lists and dropdown boxes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you've never used a double entry book-keeping system before, the basic
 idea is that you have a collection of transactions.
 Each transaction contains a source account and a destination account -
 this means that you are always moving money from one account to another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Accounts can be real, such as bank accounts, credit cards, loans, etc.
 or purely for accounting purposes (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

nominal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 accounts to use the correct terminology).
 You create income and expense accounts to categorise how money enters and
 leaves your shelter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, to pay an electricity bill, you would create a transaction
 that takes the money from your real current account, and moves it to your
 electricity expense account.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because every transaction has two sides, this system enables you to easily
 see what is being spent on electricity (for example), or how much money
 has been made via various income sources.

When adding transactions, ASM already knows which account you were looking

 You can also specify whether it is a deposit or a withdrawal to determine
 which way the money is going.

\begin_layout Section
Reconciliation

\begin_layout Standard
Reconciliation is the process of checking a real bank account statement

 It is simply a flag that you have verified the transaction.
 You can blanket mark all transactions reconciled up until today's date
 from the account screen as a handy shortcut.

From both the accounts and transaction list screens, you can also hold down
 CTRL when clicking to select multiple transactions/accounts when deleting
 or marking items as reconciled.

Donations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ASM already knows about your donations and by default will save you time

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you create a donation type category, ASM will automatically create
 a matching nominal income account for it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you add a new donation to the system, ASM will automatically create
 a matching transaction, taking the money from the donation type nominal
 account and moving it to the account of your choice (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The default destination account for donations is the first bank account
 listed if you do not change it.

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

SQL
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (short for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Structured Query Language
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 SQL
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
SQL
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is a language for retrieving and formatting information - underneath, ASM
 uses this language to talk to its database (Either HSQLDB
\begin_inset Index idx

\begin_layout Plain Layout
HSQLDB
\end_layout

\end_inset

, MySQL
\begin_inset Index idx

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 or PostgreSQL
\begin_inset Index idx

\end_layout

\end_inset

 - as the names imply, they all talk SQL).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The custom reports editing screen is located under the System menu, any
 reports you create will integrate into the Reports menu.
 You can also use this screen to rearrange and rename standard reports and
 charts in the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to just creating queries, you can then format how the data is
 transformed and displayed to you in the format of a report.
 Again, this is done through the use of another language - HTML
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
HTML
\end_layout

\end_inset

 (HyperText Markup Language).
 This is the same language used for creating web pages on the internet.
 Note however that the custom report editor has a button to automatically
 run your query and generate the HTML automatically for you in a simple
 table format.
 It is worthwhile running this and then modifying the HTML afterwards.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The centre of the custom report editor holds a drop down box and a list.
 The drop down contains a list of all tables in ASM and selecting one will
 populate the list with all the fields in that table.

SQL Keys
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This all seems very well, but what happens if you want to create a custom
 report that needs to request specific information from the user before
 running - eg: To filter between two dates, or only show animals of a particular
 species, etc?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ASM offers SQL preprocessor instructions to allow you to substitute system
 information, or information requested from the user at report generation
 time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
$USER$
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\series bold
$USER$
\end_layout

\end_inset


\series default
 - Substitutes the current user's name.
 This is useful with CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE instructions to ensure that
 users get their own versions of temporary tables when generating reports.
 It could also be used to filter reports to only show users records they
 created, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
$CURRENT_DATE$
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\series bold
$CURRENT_DATE$
\end_layout

\end_inset


\series default
 - Substitutes today's date in an appropriate string SQL format for the
 current database.
 This saves you having to use NOW() or CURRENT_DATE() or various other SQL
 functions specific to one database.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
$PARENTKEY$
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\series bold
$PARENTKEY$
\end_layout

\end_inset


\series default
 - Substitutes the field value named in the report calling this subreport.
 For example, a report could pass an Animal ID as the parent key to a subreport
 for filtering data correctly.
 When you use this key in your report SQL, ASM assumes that this report
 is a subreport and will not display it on the menu.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
ASK
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
ASK
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ask is quite a detailed key, which requests information from the user at
 generation time.
 The basic syntax is this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
$ASK [DATE | [ALL]ANIMAL | LITTER | SPECIES | LOCATION | TYPE | NUMBER |
 STRING] [Message]$
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that if you are substituting any kind of string value (ASK DATE or
 ASK STRING), you must wrap the ASK key inside string delimiters (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

 or ') otherwise you will get SQL errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The types are outlined below:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
$ASK DATE message$
\series default
 - requests a date from the user.
 A popup is displayed containing the message and the user is given an ASM
 date control to use to select the date.
 The value substituted is the date selected by the user in SQL string format
 appropriate for the database you are using.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
$ASK ANIMAL$ 
\series default
- requests an animal.
 A popup displays a list of all animals on the shelter.
 The value substituted is the animal ID.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
$ASK ALLANIMAL$ 
\series default
- requests an animal.
 A popup displays a list of all animals in the database.
 The value substituted is the animal ID.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
$ASK LITTER$
\series default
 - requests a litter identifier.
 A popup displays a list of the recent, active litters on the system.
 The value returned is the litter ID as a string.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
$ASK SPECIES$
\series default
 - requests a species from the user.
 A popup is displayed containing a dropdown of all species on the system
 with an additional entry for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

all
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The value substituted is the ID of the selected species, or 0 if 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

all
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 was selected (use the SQL CASE statement to adapt the WHERE clause for
 all)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
$ASK LOCATION$
\series default
 - requests an internal location from the user in the same manner as $ASK
 SPECIES$
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
$ASK VOUCHER$
\series default
 - requests a voucher from the user in the same manner as $ASK SPECIES$
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
$ASK DIET$
\series default
 - requests a diet from the user in the same manner as $ASK SPECIES$
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
$ASK TYPE$
\series default
 - requests an animal type from the user in the same manner as $ASK SPECIES$
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
$ASK NUMBER message$
\series default
 - requests a numeric value from the user.
 A box is popped up containing the message and the user is given a standard
 text box to enter the number in.
 They will not be allowed to continue until a valid number is entered.
 The value returned is the number.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
$ASK STRING message$
\series default
 - requests a string value from the user (eg: Name, Address, etc.).
 A box is popped up containing the message and the user is given a text
 box to enter the string in.
 The value substituted is the string.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
VAR
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
VAR
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
VAR works just like ASK, the only difference is that instead of substituting
 the value into the SQL, it stores it to a variable name.
 You can then substitute the variable multiple times in your SQL.
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
$VAR <varname> [DATE | [ALL]ANIMAL | LITTER | SPECIES | LOCATION | TYPE
 | NUMBER | STRING] [Message]$
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The VAR tag should appear in your SQL before you reference the variable
 created.
 The variable is substituted with $@varname$
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This example shows a list of animals of a selected species brought in after
 the given date.
 The species and broughtinafter variables could be reused as many times
 as we like.
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
SELECT
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
$VAR species SPECIES$
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
$VAR broughtinafter DATE The date the animals were brought in after$
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
AnimalName, DateBroughtIn
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
FROM animal
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
WHERE SpeciesID=$@species$
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
AND DateBroughtIn >= '$@broughtinafter$'
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, ASM allows you to do a number of transformations to the output
 HTML.
 You define a number of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

blocks
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to your reports.
 Anyone who has used a reporting tool (eg: Microsoft Access or Crystal)
 will recognise these.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
$$HEADER ...
 HEADER$$
\series default
 - The topmost section of the report should be entered here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
$$FOOTER ...
 FOOTER$$
\series default
 - The bottom most section of the report should be entered here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
$$BODY ...
 BODY$$
\series default
 - The main section of your report where the detail goes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
$$GROUP_<field> ..
 GROUP$$
\series default
 - Optional grouping level.
 If you want to group by a particular field in the formatted output, you
 should add a group block.
 Within the group block you must also define a 
\series bold
$$HEAD
\series default
 and 
\series bold
$$FOOT
\series default
 section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, to group on the OwnerName field:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
$GROUP_OwnerName
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
$HEAD
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
<h2>$OwnerName</h2>
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
$FOOT
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
<p>Number of owners with name '$OwnerName': {COUNT.OwnerName}</p>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ASM also offers a number of calculation instructions you may use in group
 
\series bold
$$FOOT
\series default
 blocks and the main 
\series bold
$$FOOTER
\series default
 block.
 These are:
\end_layout

 Eg: {SQL.SELECT COUNT(*) FROM animal}.
 This tag is also available in the 
\series bold
$$BODY
\series default
 block and can be used in conjunction with the field tags to produce a subquery.
 Eg: Suppose you wanted to show the number of movements attached to a particular
 animal without doing a group query with an inner join to adoption.
 You could just use {SQL.SELECT COUNT(*) FROM adoption WHERE AnimalID = $ID}

Temporary tables
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Often, it is difficult to get all the information you need to generate a
 report together in one single query.
 ASM's custom report editor allows you to enter multiple SQL instructions,
 separated by a semi-colon (;)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This works just like any SQL console editor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can use this feature to create temporary tables of information and populate
 them with multiple queries.
 The only stipulation ASM makes is that the last query in your set MUST
 be a SELECT query (returning the results of the temporary table).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ASM will automatically detect your usage of CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE and clean
 them up for you, so you do not need to add 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

DROP TABLE x
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 queries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Eg: This simple query set will aggregate all the animal names into a separate
 table which can then be output by a custom report:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE tt$USER$ ( aname varchar(50) );
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
INSERT INTO tt$USER$ (aname) SELECT AnimalName FROM animal;
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
SELECT * FROM tt$USER$
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note the use of the $USER$ SQL tag to make sure the temporary table is unique
 for each user.
 The ASM custom report editor is capable of syntax checking all queries
 and autogenerating the correct HTML from a multi-query set.

 The difference is that instead of generating HTML, you just put the word
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

GRAPH
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (without the speechmarks) in the HTML box to indicate you want ASM to draw
 a graph instead.
 All the SQL keys, including $ASK and $VAR are still supported in the normal
 way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ASM will dissect the results of the query in the following way to generate
 a graph:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Each row in your result data becomes a point on the X axis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The first column in each row is assumed to contain the name used for the
 label on the X axis.
 Only string data should be used for the first column.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Each subsequent column is assumed to be a piece of data at that point on
 the X axis (and thus gives the Y axis its scale).
 Only numeric data can appear in columns after the first one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The fieldname of each column after the label column is used to denote the
 data on the legend.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, this SQL will produce a graph that shows the amount of donations
 from animal movements each year.
 Following our scheme, the Year column being first is the X axis label,
 TotalAmount is the first datapoint for that item on the X axis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
SELECT 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
YEAR(DateReceived) AS Year, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
SUM(ownerdonation.Donation) AS TotalAmount 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
WHERE MovementID > 0
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
GROUP BY YEAR(DateReceived) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

The litter logger is accessible from 
\series bold

 The main screen shows you a list of all currently active litters on the
 shelter (you can optionally tick the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Include Expired
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 box to see litters that have expired and are less than 12 months old).
 A litter is deemed active whilever any of the animals who were part of
 it are still on the shelter or it has an expiry date later than today.

\begin_layout Section
Completion Procedures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Depending on your shelter's practices, there are three different ways of
 completing a litter (indicating that all the animals in it have left the
 shelter and it should not be included in figures any more).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Automatic Litter Identification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By default, ASM has a system option enabled called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Automatic Litter Identification
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This means that any new litters you create will be automatically assigned
 a unique identifier.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A button is available on the edit animal toolbar allowing you to assign
 an animal to a litter.
 This populates the Litter ID field on the animal to show that it is part
 of the litter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once this is done, you don't need to do anything further, as ASM will watch
 for the animals leaving the shelter and automatically complete the litter
 for you.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This method is the most recommended and works in the exact same manner as
 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

acceptance numbers
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 method outlined below.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They are in fact the same, differing only in terminology - acceptance numbers
 only apply to RSPCA shelters in the UK, litter IDs are generic for any
 shelter.
 Note that while ASM will default the litter ID as a number when you create
 a new one, the litter ID can in fact be alphanumeric and you could use
 codenames or anything more meaningful as a litter ID (as long as it is
 unique).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As far as ASM is concerned, acceptance numbers and litter IDs are exactly
 the same thing and changing a configuration option (Automatic Litter Identifica
tion) determines what ASM will call the field on screen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Manually
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most difficult method, you must periodically check the litter records
 and enter the completion date accordingly for litters that have gone.
 This can be extremely inaccurate and is not recommended.
 It is here purely so that shelters can use litter facilities if they are
 unable to use the other methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
After a Specific Time Period
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may optionally specify a date at which the litter will automatically
 become invalid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

 and Litter IDs

\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under this method, the system will check all the animals in the litter daily
 and the moment the last one has left the shelter through a means other
 than fostering (if the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Foster animals are shelter inventory
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 option is on), the litter will be cancelled.
 This method is 100% accurate and once you have entered the litter, you
 do not have to do anything else - the system will take care of it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the litter logger main screen, you can highlight a litter and call
 up all the animals in that litter.
 The litter logger main screen will also show you how many of the litter
 animals are currently left on the shelter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This method works best when employed with the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

after a specific time period
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 option, so you create the litter and give it a timeout date (when all the
 animals in the litter will be too old to constitute a litter - ASM will
 default this date for you as 6 months when you create a new litter).
 This way, the litter will expire on the day the last animal is adopted
 out, or the timeout date - whichever comes first.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note, some shelters book in mother and litter together on the same acceptance
 number/Litter ID - the system can cope with this quite happily as 
\emph on
animals under 6 months old are automatically excluded
\emph default
 when using the acceptance number scheme.

 You may choose an age limit on animals that appear.
 By default, the system excludes animals less than 1 year old (52 weeks).
\end_layout

 you'll need to set this option to make sure the updated image is sent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Upload Directly to the Internet:
\series default
 Ticking this box will cause the publisher to upload your site directly
 to the internet as it is building it.

 by your ISP (see next section).
 You must also be connected and online.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Generate thumbnail images: 
\series default
The publisher will create thumbnails of all the animal images.
 Thumbnail images are 70 pixels along the longest side and have the same
 name as the animal image, but are prefixed with tn_.
 You can use tn_$$WebMediaFilename$$ in a template to get the thumbnail
 image for the current animal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Scale Images:
\series default
 Modern digital cameras can take very high quality images - so much so that
 they could take a very long time for users to download (particularly for
 people with modems).
 Also, if your shelter's connection to the internet is over a modem, it
 could take a long time for the site to upload.
 This box allows you to reduce the size of your images to scaled JPEGs with
 the resolutions specified.
 By default, the internet publishing template shows images at 320x200 in
 the user's browser, so it is best to set the scale option here to match
 (using this will not degrade the quality noticeably and can reduce your
 file size by as much as 3,000% !).
 By default, the system does not scale your images.
 If your images are smaller than the scale you set them to here, the system
 will intelligently increase the size (while attempting to retain the quality)
 to ensure that the images are a good size, and that all images on your
 site are of the same size and quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Include Animals In Location:
\series default
 You may well not want to include animals who are in a certain location

 from.
 By default, all locations are ticked.

\begin_layout Standard
A mail merge source is simply a database file containing the information
 you would like to use to generate multiple letters.
 If you are using OpenOffice, you can use it to filter the source beyond
 that produced by Animal Shelter Manager.

 Another option is available to select the default waiting list urgency
 - this is the default start value given to new waiting list entries.
 You can also choose hold separate rankings for species on the waiting list.
 This makes sense if your shelter takes dogs and cats for example and whether
 you can take a cat is independent of how many dogs are on the shelter.

normal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 code, unique among all animals and the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

short
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 code.
 The short code does not have to be unique and is used by staff wanting
 to quickly identify animals in conversation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The defaults are TYYYYNNN (the first letter of the animal type, followed
 by the year it was brought to the shelter, followed by a number unique
 within that year for that type of animal) for the normal code and NNT for
 the shortcode (a unique number within the year for the animal's type, followed
 by the type).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can build and use any format string you like, using the following tokens:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
YYYY - The year the animal was brought into the shelter (4 digits)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
YY - The year the animal was brought into the shelter (2 digits)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
MM - The month the animal was brought into the shelter
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
DD - The day the animal was brought into the shelter
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
T - The first letter of the animal's type
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
UUUUUUUUUU - (10 digits) a unique number representing the animal (this number
 will never be used for another animal), padded to 10 digits.
 If the number overflows, more digits will be used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
UUUU - (4 digits) a unique number representing the animal (this number will
 never be used for another animal), padded to 4 digits.
 If the number overflows, more digits will be used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
NNN - (3 digits) a number representing the animal, which is unique within
 the year brought in for the animal's type and padded to 3 digits.
 If the number overflows, more digits will be used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
NN - A number representing the animal, which is unique within the year brought
 in for the animal's type.
 No padding is done.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here are some examples:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
YYYYMMDD-NNN-T (an ISO date, followed by a unique number/type within the
 year).
 Eg: 20080520-001-D
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
TUUUUUUUUUU (the animal's type, followed by a unique number for the animal)
 - Eg: U0000003412
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you change the coding formats when you already have animals on file using
 a different format, those animals will be ignored when creating new codes
 and multiple codes can co-exist.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any values you put in your codes other than these tokens (such as punctuation
 or other letters) will not be substituted and will be retained in generated
 codes.
 For example, the format NNN:21:T will produce 001:21:D for the first dog
 of the year.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you do not want ASM to supply codes to your animals (you will have to
 manually enter them yourself), you need to set both coding formats (regular

 This option tells ASM to display the short code throughout the application
 instead of the main shelter code.
\end_layout

\series default
 Setting this option will cause ASM to automatically generate a shelter
 code when you create a new animal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Hide short shelter codes on the animal details screen:
\series default
 Setting this option will make ASM hide the short shelter code field at
 the top left of the animal details screen.
 It does not stop ASM generating short codes behind the scenes, it just
 stops them being visible on the screen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Enforce animal codes entered by users conform to the selected animal coding
 scheme:
\series default
 Setting this option will cause ASM to try and reparse animal codes when
 saving an animal - if it fails, it will not allow saving of the animal's
 record until a valid code is generated or set by the user.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Once assigned, codes cannot be changed:
\series default
 Setting this option will make ASM lock the shelter code fields, as well
 as the type and brought in date once an animal record has been saved for
 the first time.
 This is to guarantee that once an animal code has been handed out, it cannot
 be changed.

\begin_layout Standard
ASM offers a number of authentication methods (ways to allow users to log
 onto the system).
 For all of them, ASM will always need a user entry in the system users
 table, these methods simply allow different ways to verify the user.

If you choose this method, ASM will look at the username of the person logged
 into the operating system.
 It will then attempt to find a user in it's own database with the same
 name.
 If one is found, the user is automatically logged in with no login screen.
 This is an appropriate method to use if you have a hot-desk type setup
 where people log into different machines.

ASM can also use an LDAP server to authenticate your users.
 ASM will prompt for a username and password on startup and will then search
 the LDAP tree for an entry matching the username entered.
 If it finds one, it will then attempt to bind to the tree as that user,
 using the password supplied.
 As ever, a matching ASM user must exist in the database.
\end_layout

: This is the URL to the ldap server, typically something like ldap://server/,
 you can supply a port as normal (eg: If you have an ActiveDirectory domain
 you'd like to use for authentication on port 3268 - ldap://server:3268/).
 You can also use ldaps:// for SSL enabled LDAP connections.
\end_layout

Warn on close if an animal has no pending vaccinations:
\series default
 All animals should need a vaccination at some point, even if it is just
 an annual booster.
 Ticking this box will make the system warn you if you close an animal record
 that has no vaccination scheduled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Warn when adopting to a non-homechecked owner:
\series default
 If the owner record does not have them down as homechecked, the system
 can warn you if you try to adopt an animal to them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Warn when adopting to a banned owner:
\series default
 The system can warn you if you try to adopt an animal to an owner who has
 been marked as banned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Warn when adopting to an owner in the same postcode as the original owner:
\series default
 Self explanatory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

Warn on multiple reservations:
\series default
 If set, the system will warn you if you attempt to reserve the same animal
 to different owners.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Warn and cancel additional reservations when an animal is adopted:
\series default
 Setting this option will cause all outstanding reservations on an animal
 to be automatically cancelled when it is adopted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
When entering new owners, check for similar names:
\series default
 Setting this option will force ASM to check new owner names as you enter
 them and let you know if you are entering an owner that is potentially
 already on the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
When entering new owners, check for similar addresses:
\series default
 Setting this option will force ASM to check new owner addresses as you
 enter them and let you know if you are entering an owner that is potentially
 already on the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Warn when adopting to an owner that has brought an animal in:
\series default
 The system can check and warn you if you attempt to adopt an animal to
 an owner who 
\emph on

 an owner who brought an animal in.
 This is a loose check based on name and address.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Format and Display
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Show internal location as logical location:
\series default
 Useful for animal searches and the main screen.
 If an animal has left the shelter (or is dead), instead of showing the
 last known internal location, you will be shown the logical location.
 This is useful in (all location) searches, as you can see immediately whether
 an animal is on the shelter, and if so, where.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Group the animal figures report by species instead of type: 
\series default
This causes the monthly animal figures report to separate animals by their
 species instead of their type (ie.
 By what they are instead of what the shelter classifies them as).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Hide original owner information when printing animal records:
\series default
 Some shelters like to use the print animal report as a cage card, since
 it contains every piece of info about the animal.
 However, with the original owner information on there, unscrupulous people
 could try to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

reclaim
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 animals they want to adopt by posing as the original owner.
 This option hides the original owner and brought in by information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Highlight animals under 6 months, reserved or dead on reports:
\series default
 Setting this option will cause any report that displays an animal's name
 to highlight it if the animal is under 6 months old, reserved or dead.
 Animals under six months are shown in blue italics, dead animals are shown
 in red and reserved animals are shown in bold.
 This allows you to quickly highlight puppies/kittens and reserved animals
 on inventories etc.
 This option only applies to the built in reports, and not custom reports
 that you add to the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Don't filter the list of breeds according to selected species: 
\series default
Normally, ASM will filter the list of breeds when you change species.
 Breeds are mapped to a single species (or available to all species) through
 the System->Lookups->Breed Mappings screen.
 If you enable this option, ASM will just show all breeds and allow you
 to select one, regardless of the selected species.
 Up until version 2.6.0, ASM did not filter the list of breeds and this was
 the default behaviour.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
When adding animals, show most popular breeds at the top of the dropdown:
\series default
 Setting this option will have ASM track the most popular breeds your shelter
 deals with and put them at the top of the breed list when adding new animals.
 It incurs a small performance penalty and is disabled by default.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Don't show media thumbnails on animal or owner screens:
\series default
 Setting this option prevents ASM displaying thumbnail images on the detail
 pages of the animal and owner screens.
 This can improve performance slightly on slower database connections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
When printing reports, don't scale to match page width: 
\series default
Normally, when printing reports, ASM will try and scale them to match the
 width of the paper.
 Turning this option on tells ASM not to do that and allows you to manually
 set the width of your reports via HTML tags.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Database and System
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Use optimistic record locking:
\series default
 Prevents two users from editing the same record at the same time.
 If you choose not to use this, database saves will be slightly faster,
 but a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

who saves last wins
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 situation will occur if two people are editing the same record.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Case sensitive searching:
\series default
 Tells ASM that you want case to matter when searching for animals and owners.
 If case sensitive is on, then searching for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

steve
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 won't find owners called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

.
 This option has another use - some locales can break the insensitive comparison
, causing nothing to be found when searching for special characters, enabling
 this option allows the use of special characters in searches for non-English
 locales.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Use Automatic Litter Identification:
\series default
 Setting this option will cause ASM to automatically assign an ID to newly
 created litters, and allow a litter ID on animal records (replacing the
 acceptance number field, which was only useful to UK RSPCA shelters).
 A button appears on the edit animal screen, allowing users to assign an
 animal to an active litter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Foster animals are shelter inventory:
\series default
 Setting this option will make ASM treat fostered animals as if they are
 on the shelter (with appropriate visual output to show they are fostered).
 Note that this option will not take effect until you restart ASM.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Cache active animals: 
\series default
Setting this option will cause ASM to cache all on shelter animals on startup.
 This speeds up opening of the animal edit screen considerably if your database
 is on a slower internet link.
 Stale cache data is updated every 10 minutes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Lazily load animal data: 
\series default
Setting this option will make ASM only load information on animal tabs when
 the tab is clicked instead of in the background once the screen opens.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Don't auto archive animal records on exit:
\series default
 By default, when you close ASM, it will scan all the animal files on record
 and update various records to make sure that various copies of internal
 records are correct.
 This is only really necessary if another process has modified the database
 that ASM doesn't know about, or you book out adoptions more than a day
 in advance.
 If you don't do either of these things, you can turn this feature off and
 save some time when closing the program.
 You can manually force auto archiving by selecting it from the menu under
 
\series bold
System->Database Tools->Auto Archive Animal Records
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Disable retailer functionality:
\series default
 If ticked, ASM will hide all of the functionality related to retailers
 (a system where pet shops adopt animals on behalf of the shelter).
 This will not take effect until you restart ASM.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Disable accounts functionality:
\series default
 If ticked, ASM will hide all of the functionality related to the accounting
 package (ASM contains a full, double entry book keeping system to track
 shelter accounts).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Use a single breed field for animals:
\series default
 Setting this option will make ASM only display a single breed field on
 the animal details screen.
 This is the norm for UK shelters, where animals are either pedigree or
 a crossbreed (a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Crossbreed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 breed can be added to the lookup).
 Without this option set, ASM allows for two breed fields and a crossbreed
 indicator so that mixed breed type animals can be recorded (this is typical
 for US shelters).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Don't show the startup page
\series default
: By default, ASM shows a startup page with today's diary notes and the
 latest news from the ASM website.
 This option disables it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Keep a full audit trail
\series default
: Ordinarily, ASM keeps a note of the person who created a record and who
 last changed it.
 If you set this option, ASM will also keep a full history of who created
 and changed records in the system, but most importantly, who deleted records
 and when.
 This audit trail can be analysed with the audit trail reports, available
 from

\begin_layout Subsection
Remove Unwanted Fields
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Remove the town/county (city and state) fields from the owner screen:
\series default
 Setting this option will prevent ASM from presenting the user with additional
 fields to store the city and state information.
 These are handy for group owner searches, but not all shelters want or
 need them and prefer to keep the complete address in the address box.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Remove the coat type field from the animal screen:
\series default
 If ticked, ASM won't display the coat type dropdown on the animal editing
 screen.
 For some shelters, keeping coat types is unnecessary (particularly for
 those that keep reptiles and birds!), so you can disable it here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Remove the microchip fields from the animal screen:
\series default
 If ticked, ASM won't display the microchip indicator, number and date fields.
 For shelters that don't keep microchipped animals (eg: Reptiles and birds).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Remove the tattoo fields from the animal screen:
\series default
 If ticked, ASM won't display the tattoo indicator, number and date fields.
 Useful for shelters that don't keep animals with ear tattoos.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Remove the spay/neutered fields from the animal screen:
\series default
 If ticked, ASM won't display the neutered/spayed flag and date.
 Useful for shelters that keep animals that do not require neutering (small
 mammals, birds, reptiles, horses, etc).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Remove the declawed field from the animal screen:
\series default
 If ticked, ASM won't display the declawed flag.
 Useful for shelters that don't keep cats, or for countries where declawing
 is illegal (such as the UK).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

 Designate one of your ASM machines as the server (whichever suits you)
 and make sure you have opened ASM at least once on the machine to make
 sure the database has been fully created.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, start the ASM Database Server process.
